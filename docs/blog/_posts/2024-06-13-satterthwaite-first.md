We are all just SO excited about the public data release of Reproducible Brain Charts initiative.
RBC is the product of nearly 5 years of sustained effort.
Our goal?
To create a well-curated, fully reproducible, super-open data resource to accelerate studies of the developing brain.

It turns out that this was a lot more complicated that we initially realized!
RBC required learning, building, and updating a lot of new tools along the way (e.g., CPAC, CuBIDS, DataLad/BABS, etc).
Given all this, we hope that this helps investigators not recreate the wheel (preprocessing! QA!), move faster, and do better science.

Run into issues?
Click the "Get Support" link in the footer and reach out to us on NeuroStars; be sure to use the `rbc` tag to make sure we find it.
We genuinely welcome your feedback and will strive to make RBC as user-friendly as possible moving forward.
In this `News` section we will highlight updates to and uses of RBC â€“ so please just reach out to Ted (sattertt at upenn dot edu) directly if you want us to highlight your work using RBC here.

Thanks for checking it out + have fun with the data!!!

-Ted, Mike, and the RBC team
