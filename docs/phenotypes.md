## Measures in the RBC
The RBC integrates baseline data from six cohorts. However, as it is common in the field, different measures are used. Four cohorts (HBN, NKI-RS, BHRCS and dCCNP) use the latest version of the Child and Behavioral Checklist (CBCL), PACCT uses a previous version of this instrument, and the PNC uses the GOASSESS questionnaire. The CBCL is a 120-item parent-report assessment of emotional and behavioral symptoms over the past 6 months, answered on a 3-point scale (0 = not true, 1 = somewhat/sometimes true, and 2 = very true/often). The GOASSESS is a structured screening questionnaire applied by trained interviewers to the caregivers that contains 112 unconditioned screening items based on 14 DSM-IV diagnosis, scored as 0 (absent) or 1 (ever present).
 
## Measure harmonization
The RBC understands that scores from different questionnaires can only be compared if harmonized. Therefore, we matched 36 items among questionnaires based of item semantic content, and used the matched items in factor models, containing all six cohorts, to extract factor scores for each participant, which weights item relevance to inform the level of mental health problems for each individual.
 
## Models of psychopathology
We tested 12 bifactor models of psychopathology, based on previous literature on the questionnaires used by the cohorts within the RBC. We focused on bifactor models to parse out general and specific constructs of emotional and behavioral phenotype, as previous evidence demonstrates advantages to capture neurobiological signatures when general and specific dimensions of psychopathology are extracted from the data. In a bifactor model, one dimension informs the variability of all items and the remain variance is explained by specific factors, which are not correlated among themselves nor with the general factor.

## Main RBC model
The model published by McElroy et al (2018) was chosen as this model better fit in all RBC cohorts, as an invariant measure of psychopathology (i.e., not influenced by the cohort but by the dimensions of mental health problems only).  This model contains 22 harmonized items, in a model with one general factor and internalizing, externalizing and attention/hyperactivity specific factors.
