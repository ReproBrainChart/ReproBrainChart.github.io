All images were manually QCed by 5 expert raters and the average of their ratings was assigned to each image as pass, borderline, or fail.
These QC files are available in the BIDS and Freesurfer repository of each dataset.

Additionally, their Euler numbers are also available.
This workflow is depicted below.
