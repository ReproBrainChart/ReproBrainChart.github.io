To achieve consistent quality ratings across all studies in RBC, every image was manually evaluated by 2-5 expert raters using Swipes for Science ([Keshavan et al., 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31139070/)). These ratings allowed us to assign each image a score of “Pass”, “Artifact”, or “Fail”. In addition to these manual ratings, we provide the Euler number, a measure calculated by FreeSurfer that quantifies the number of surface holes. In prior work, the Euler number ([Rosen et al., 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29278774/)) has shown to be an accurate, fully-automated measure of data quality; it captures variation in data quality within the coarse categories provided by manual ratings.
